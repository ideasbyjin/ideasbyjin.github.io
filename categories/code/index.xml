One of the potential downsides to using Python (apart from whitespace, non-static typing) is its speed. It&amp;rsquo;s certainly faster than languages such as R, but it&amp;rsquo;s nowhere near the level of C/C++. In fact, many Python modules are already written in C/C++ (such as NumPy) but it might be practical to have your own C/C++ code to interface with your Python objects.</description></item></channel></rss>
