Iâ€™m a biochemist-turned-bioinformatician. Since my D.Phil (PhD) days, I have been fascinated by the prospect of using
technology, domain knowledge, and of course, data, to tackle some big problems in biomedical informatics. More broadly,
I like to think about how "what makes us human" can help us solve problems and design algorithms.

In my spare time, I apply lessons from tech and data science to other domains (e.g. sports). Oh, and I cycle and bake
a bit.
