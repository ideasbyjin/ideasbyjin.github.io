description: Hugo migration update
---

I've recently migrated my blog to Hugo instead of Jekyll. It's an ongoing process and there might
be some broken  elements (e.g. images) but will get to updating these soon. In the meantime,
enjoy the new format.

I'll do a post at some stage about how I've done this. Long story short, I was a bit tired of
Jekyll's dependency on Ruby which required a lot of tinkering on my Mac (with the Big Sur update).
In fact, I'm still not sure how the Ruby version permutations had ended up working out for me,
but I decided to go for something more modern and sleek. Not to mention searchability, an archive
format, and reading time estimates were huge wins for me.

Enjoy!
