    "# Accelerating code with Numba\n",
    "\n",
    "I've discovered numba a few months ago, and haven't looked back since. I wouldn't consider myself a `numba` expert as there's lots of capabilities I'm still wrapping my head around (e.g. `@overload` decorators), but there's some use cases where Numba could be really useful. If you find you're doing a lot of `numpy` for your work, this is for you!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have:\n",
    "* **30 seconds**: `@numba.jit(nopython=True)` your functions if it's purely numpy driven. Can be a bit of effort though.\n",
    "* **5 minutes**: read on.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Okay, what is numba, exactly?\n",
    "Numba is a \"just-in-time\" (JIT) compiler, which essentially means that a function you create will be compiled and can run independently of the Python interpreter. Simply, if your code involves lots of `numpy` and math, chances are, you can speed it up _even_ more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### That sounds great, but...\n",
    "Anecdotally speaking I've seen about 100-200x performance gains for some of the functions I've written with `numba`. The beauty of it is that it involves almost no work, provided that the code is mostly already in `numpy`, and that `numba` is compatible with your implementation. This is the catch that I think the 5-minute `numba` docs don't cover.\n",
    "\n",
    "`numba` is heavily typed and has specific implementations and signatures of `numpy` functions. In other words, you might have found that you can \"get away\" with calling `numpy` in specific ways in \"normal\" Python, but upon compiling with `numba`, you will come to some very surprising errors. You could argue that this is helpful though.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "The example we're going to cover is the RAPDF function from [Samudrala and Moult](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9480776/). RAPDF represents a sort of log odds ratio that two atoms of types $i$ and $j$ come into contact in a specific distance bin $d$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\textrm{RAPDF} = -log\\left(\\dfrac{\\dfrac{n(d_{ij})}{\\sum_d n(d_{ij})}}{\\dfrac{\\sum_{ij} n(d_{ij})}{\\sum_d \\sum_{ij} n(d_{ij})}}\\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is typically the kind of data where RAPDF would be applied to; I've simplified the contacts to amino acids rather than atoms, but in practice, it would involve the same computation:"
