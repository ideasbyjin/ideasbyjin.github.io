I'm a biochemist-turned-bioinformatician. Since my D.Phil (PhD) days, I have been fascinated by the
prospect of using technology, domain knowledge, and of course, data, to tackle some big problems in
biomedical informatics.

In my spare time, I apply lessons from tech and data science to other domains (e.g. sports), to hopefully
win a fantasy league of some sorts. Oh, and I cycle a bit. Follow me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/8855696).
