In fact, for the purposes of calculating RMSD for model prediction, we often find this optimal alignment first, _then_ measure the RMSD.\n",

This does **not** mean that there has to be an _exact amino acid sequence match_ between the native structure and the predicted structure. However, a mechanism to compare them should be considered. Simply using residue numbers doesn't always work, either! (but this is for another time)\n",
