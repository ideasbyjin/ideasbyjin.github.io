summary: The books I've read in Q1 2020.

Following on my [book review of 2019](../../../2019/12/31/bookreview.html), I've decided to divide this year's
piece into four chunks according to the quarters of the year. Here's my thoughts on the four books I've read so
far.  

## Born a Crime

This has definitely been the page-turning read of 2020 so far. I'm a bit late to the Trevor Noah autobiography
game, but this piece manages to combine political critique, great humour, and touch on elements of purpose. I
started this in a plane and couldn't put it down. A must-read for anyone who wants to know more about Apartheid,
or pranking in a way only comedians know how.

## Convenience Store Woman

This has to be one of the strangest books I've ever read. It has a Camus-style of dry humour about it, where the
protagonist is very much living a life of routine existensialism. The deadpan nature of the book is surprisingly
good, and while I don't think I'd rave about it, it's worth a try if you want something a bit different! 

## Uninhabitable Earth

</div>

This book starts off in tremendous pace, talking about the harsh realities of global warming and what it means
to the future of mankind. The book offers almost zero optimism to the planet's future, and no real solutions for
the reader, either. After about 2-3 chapters, it almost feels more like a rant than it is a scientific discussion
on what we must do in order to tackle global warming. Not to mention the book contains zero figures! 

However, and most importantly, I'm afraid the book suffers from poor scientific writing standards. For example,
the book continually uses Fahrenheit and Celsius in interchangeable ways. In addition, the book mentions percentages
after percentages, numbers after numbers - but how do we interpret these numbers? As a bioinformatician/data
scientist, one takeaway I had from this book was just how much scientists must adhere to, and practice, good
communication skills. Through deliberate practice and rigour, this will help deliver impact and convey the importance
of observations in our data, and form strategies for further action.

## Ultralearning

This is a bit of a cheat - I actually started this book midway 2019 and stopped briefly because I was reading
Bad Blood and lost track - how ironic! Either way, if you're not familiar with Scott Young's material, I think
it's brilliant as usual, and this book is a friendly introduction to more deliberate epistemology. Side note:
if you already read a bit of Scott Young's material, there are some elements that I feel are repeats of what
he has mentioned prior. Having said that, the anecdotes of individual "Ultralarning" brilliance are incredibly
interesting (e.g. the story of Van Gogh's rise as a painter, Judit Polgar... etc.)

I'm expecting Q2 to be a bit slower, but there will be more reviews next time!
