summary: These are the books of 2019 that I found to be thought-provoking.

Following on some amazing heroes like [Barack Obama](https://twitter.com/barackobama) and [Bill Gates](https://twitter.com/billgates),
I've decided to reflect back on the past year and do a quick-ish review on some books I've read in 2019.
I'm hoping that 2020 will be a year where I'll get to read more and do something a bit more comprehensive.

## Bad Blood

This is one of those books that made me thinking,
> Holy sh*t

with every chapter. As a slow reader, I go through one book roughly every 2 months, but I went through this in
a week during my commutes to work. The writing is brilliant; it feels like watching a Netflix series, but in
text. Ultimately, I was reminded that the work I do has long-term purpose and implications, giving me the onus
to do things even more diligently and responsibly. This is something I'd recommend to anyone working in tech
and/or medicine.    

## Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine

Historically, I didn't read a lot of fiction until this year. I always maintain the idea that I want to read something
that will make me either laugh or think. This book managed to do both, and refreshed my desire to read fiction again. 

It does have a British style of humour, and the writing style is perhaps not for everyone. Most importantly, it opens
readers to sensitive issues, and (I think) encourages a healthy debate around topics like loneliness that can be taboos
for many. It can get dark, be warned!  

## Freakonomics

Not exactly the "newest" book to get off the shelves, but this was a very thought-provoking book indeed. As a
bioinformatician / data scientist, I think books like these remind us that **there is more than meets the eye**.
In other words, what may seem like obvious correlations are essentially confounders, and we need to do deeper
analyses to look at the causative agents that account for variations in our observations. For example, Levitt and
Dubner touch on how a reduction in crime is a consequence of _reduced abortions_, and _not_ increased police numbers.

## Brave New World
<div style="text-align: center">

</div>

Again, an old classic, but one where I saw many parallels with our society today. Instead of _soma_, I would
argue that today's "happy drug" is our smartphone - see the screen a bit, and you're jolted back to life. Given
that (possibly) my favourite fiction of all time is 1984, I was hoping to enjoy _Brave New World_ just as much. While
I found Aldous Huxley to be a bit drier than Orwell, it was shocking to see how many aspects of the book (e.g. the
division of classes, low-key racism) are still making headlines today. 

## Fahrenheit 451  
<div style="text-align: center">

</div>

The last of old classics in the list for 2019. Another reminder of why books are, in my view, under-rated in
today's society, and deserve more attention. While it's hard to imagine a society where books will be eradicated
forever, Fahrenheit 451 reminds us that the fundamental spread of the best information, knowledge, and wisdom are
in books, and they should be held as treasures.   

## Meaning of Marriage
<div style="text-align: center">

Earlier this year, my wife and I got married in a church ceremony. This book was a good reminder for the types
of values that we want to uphold in our marriage, and confirm our commitment to doing so. As per Tim Keller's
usual style, expect lots of C.S. Lewis and Biblical references.
